//computer thinking

// Completely random -> Pick a random column to place a tile in
// Slightly Better -> If thereâ€™s a column with one of your tiles in,
// pick that, else Go to 1
// Slightly Better Still -> Pick the column which has the slot which
// will complete the longest available line of your pieces
//(this needs breaking down itself, but you get the picture), or Go to 2
// Good - Look for almost complete lines, if you find one then
// complete it, else Go to 3
// etc etc

//available slots
